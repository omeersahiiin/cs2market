# Crypto Integration for Turkish Users ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·

## Issue: Binance Geographic Restrictions in Turkey

### Option 3: Manual Deposit System (Temporary Solution)

For immediate deployment, you can implement a manual deposit confirmation system:

1. **Users send crypto to your provided addresses**
2. **Admin manually confirms deposits** through admin panel
3. **Balances updated manually** until API integration is complete

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Set up manual deposit system
2. **Short-term**: Integrate with Paribu or BtcTurk API
3. **Long-term**: Add multiple exchange support

## Next Steps

1. Choose a Turkish exchange (Paribu recommended)
2. Create account and generate API keys
3. Update the crypto integration to use Turkish exchange API
4. Test with small amounts first

## Environment Variables for Turkish Exchanges

### For Paribu:
```
PARIBU_API_KEY=your_paribu_api_key
PARIBU_SECRET_KEY=your_paribu_secret_key
CRYPTO_EXCHANGE=paribu
```

### For BtcTurk:
```
BTCTURK_API_KEY=your_btcturk_api_key
BTCTURK_SECRET_KEY=your_btcturk_secret_key
CRYPTO_EXCHANGE=btcturk
```

This approach will be much more reliable for Turkish users and comply with local regulations.
