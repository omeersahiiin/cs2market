## üìä What is Derivatives Trading?

**Derivatives trading** lets you trade on the price movements of CS2 skins without actually owning them. You can:

- **Go LONG**: Bet that a skin's price will go UP
- **Go SHORT**: Bet that a skin's price will go DOWN

### Example:
- AK-47 Redline is trading at $100
- You think it will go up, so you go **LONG** with 10 units
- If the price goes to $110, you make $100 profit (10 units √ó $10 increase)
- If the price goes to $90, you lose $100 (10 units √ó $10 decrease)

## üéØ How to Trade

### 1. Choose a Skin
- Browse the available CS2 skins on the main page
- Click on any skin to open its trading interface

### 2. Analyze the Market
- **Candlestick Chart**: Shows price movements over time
  - Green candles = price went up
  - Red candles = price went down
- **Order Book**: Shows current buy/sell orders
  - Bids (left) = people wanting to buy
  - Asks (right) = people wanting to sell

### 3. Place Your Order

#### Market Order (Instant)
- **Buy Market**: Instantly go LONG at current market price
- **Sell Market**: Instantly go SHORT at current market price

#### Limit Order (Set Your Price)
- **Buy Limit**: Go LONG when price reaches your target
- **Sell Limit**: Go SHORT when price reaches your target

### 4. Monitor Your Positions
- Check your **Positions** tab to see:
  - Entry price
  - Current P&L (profit/loss)
  - Position size
  - Margin used

## üí∞ Understanding P&L (Profit & Loss)

### LONG Position
- **Profit**: When price goes UP from your entry price
- **Loss**: When price goes DOWN from your entry price
- **Formula**: (Current Price - Entry Price) √ó Position Size

### SHORT Position
- **Profit**: When price goes DOWN from your entry price
- **Loss**: When price goes UP from your entry price
- **Formula**: (Entry Price - Current Price) √ó Position Size

### Example:
- You go LONG 10 units of AK-47 at $100
- Price moves to $105
- Your P&L = ($105 - $100) √ó 10 = +$50 profit

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management
