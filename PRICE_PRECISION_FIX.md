# Price Precision Fix

## Problem
The order book was showing prices with excessive decimal places due to floating-point precision errors in JavaScript:

```
❌ BEFORE:
- $83.03046875000001 (15+ decimal places!)
- $82.511396484375 (12 decimal places)
- $83.030625 (6 decimal places)
```

## Root Cause
Floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript creates precision errors when performing calculations like:
```javascript
// These operations can create precision errors:
targetBid = externalPrice - baseSpread * 0.7;  // 83.50 - 0.5 * 0.7 = 83.14999999999999
targetAsk = externalPrice + baseSpread * 0.3;  // 83.50 + 0.5 * 0.3 = 83.15000000000001
midpoint = (bestBid + bestAsk) / 2;            // Can create precision errors
```

## Solution
Added a `roundPrice()` utility function that rounds all prices to exactly 2 decimal places:

```javascript
function roundPrice(price: number): number {
  return Math.round(price * 100) / 100;
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. Market Maker (`src/lib/marketMaker.ts`)
- Added `roundPrice()` function
- Applied rounding to all target price calculations:
  ```typescript
  targetBid = roundPrice(externalPrice - baseSpread * 0.7);
  targetAsk = roundPrice(externalPrice + baseSpread * 0.3);
  ```

### 2. Order Matching Engine (`src/lib/orderMatchingEngine.ts`)
- Added `roundPrice()` function
- Applied rounding to:
  - Market price midpoint calculations
  - Market order price adjustments
  - All order prices before database storage

### 3. Frontend Order Form (`src/components/OrderBook.tsx`)
- Added client-side price rounding
- Automatic rounding when users type prices
- Rounded prices for quick-select buttons

## Database Cleanup
Ran a one-time script to fix existing orders with precision issues:
- Fixed 9 orders with floating-point precision problems
- All active orders now have proper 2-decimal precision

## Result
```
✅ AFTER:
- $83.03 (exactly 2 decimal places)
- $82.51 (exactly 2 decimal places)
- $83.06 (exactly 2 decimal places)
```

## Prevention
- All new orders are automatically rounded to 2 decimal places
- Frontend prevents users from entering invalid precision
- Backend validates and rounds all prices before storage
- Market maker generates only properly rounded prices

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Running the price precision fix script
2. Checking the order book shows clean prices
3. Testing new order placement with proper rounding
4. Verifying market maker generates rounded prices

This ensures a professional trading experience similar to major exchanges like Binance, where all prices are displayed with consistent decimal precision.
